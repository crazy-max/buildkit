BuildKit is a project for building and packaging software using containers. It's a new codebase meant to replace the internals of the current build features in the Moby Engine. BuildKit emerged from the discussions about improving the build features in Moby Engine. We received a lot of positive feedback for the multi-stage build feature introduced in April and had proposals and user requests for many similar additions. But before that, we needed to make sure that we have capabilities to continue adding such features in the future and a solid foundation to extend on. Quite soon it was clear that we would need to redefine most of the fundamentals about how we even define a build operation and needed a clean break from the current codebase. A proposal was written, and development started in the open under the new repository . In parallel, work had started on the new container runtime containerd 1.0, so BuildKit is based on the work done in that repository. For example, it uses containerd snapshot, execution and image libraries. BuildKit can also be built in a version that tightly integrates with containerd, using an existing containerd daemon for the storage and sharing it with other containerd clients. Apart from many new features, the main areas BuildKit improves on the current experience are performance, storage management, and extensibility. From the performance side, a significant update is a new fully concurrent build graph solver. It can run build steps in parallel when possible and optimize out commands that don\u2019t have an impact on the final result. We have also optimized the access to the local source files. By tracking only the updates made to these files between repeated build invocations, there is no need to wait for local files to be read or uploaded before the work can begin. LLB \u00b6 At the core of BuildKit is a new low-level build definition format called LLB (low-level builder). This is an intermediate binary format that end users are not exposed to but allows to easily build on top of BuildKit. LLB defines a content-addressable dependency graph that can be used to put together very complex build definitions. It also supports features not exposed in Dockerfiles, like direct data mounting and nested invocation. Everything about execution and caching of your builds is defined only in LLB. The caching model is entirely rewritten compared to the current Dockerfile builder. Instead of doing heuristics to compare images, it can directly track the checksums of build graphs and content mounted to specific operations. This makes it much faster, more precise and portable. The build cache can even be exported to a registry, where it can be pulled on-demand by subsequent invocations on any host. LLB can be generated directly using a golang client package that allows defining the relationships between your build operations using Go language primitives. This gives you full power to run anything you can imagine, but will probably not be how most people will define their builds. Instead, we expect most users to use a frontend component or LLB nested invocation to run some prepared combination of build steps. A frontend is a component that takes a human-readable build format and converts it to LLB so BuildKit can execute it. Frontends can be distributed as images, and the user can target a specific version of a frontend that is guaranteed to work for the features used by their definition. For example, to build a Dockerfile with BuildKit , you would use an external Dockerfile frontend .","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#introduction","text":"Note See the original blog post: Introducing BuildKit .

BuildKit is composed of the buildkitd daemon and the buildctl client. While the buildctl client is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows, the buildkitd daemon is only available for Linux currently. The buildkitd daemon requires the following components to be installed: runc or crun containerd (if you want to use containerd worker) The latest binaries of BuildKit are available here for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Homebrew package (unofficial) is available for macOS: brew install buildkit To build BuildKit from source, see the Contributing page . Starting the buildkitd daemon \u00b6 You need to run buildkitd as the root user on the host. sudo buildkitd To run buildkitd as a non-root user, see the rootless mode guide . The buildkitd daemon supports two worker backends: OCI (runc) and containerd. By default, the OCI (runc) worker is used. You can set --oci-worker=false --containerd-worker=true to use the containerd worker. We are open to adding more backends. Systemd socket activation \u00b6 To start the buildkitd daemon using systemd socket activiation, you can install the buildkit systemd unit files. On Systemd based systems, you can communicate with the daemon via Systemd socket activation , use buildkitd --addr fd:// . Tip You can find examples of using Systemd socket activation with BuildKit and Systemd in ./examples/systemd . Expose BuildKit as a TCP service \u00b6 The buildkitd daemon listens gRPC API on /run/buildkit/buildkitd.sock by default, but you can also use TCP sockets. It is highly recommended to create TLS certificates for both the daemon and the client (mTLS). Enabling TCP without mTLS is dangerous because the executor containers (aka Dockerfile RUN containers) can call BuildKit API as well. buildkitd \\ --addr tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 \\ --tlscacert /path/to/ca.pem \\ --tlscert /path/to/cert.pem \\ --tlskey /path/to/key.pem buildctl \\ --addr tcp://example.com:1234 \\ --tlscacert /path/to/ca.pem \\ --tlscert /path/to/clientcert.pem \\ --tlskey /path/to/clientkey.pem \\ build ... Load balancing \u00b6 buildctl build can be called against randomly load balanced the buildkitd daemon. Tip If you have multiple BuildKit daemon instances, but you don't want to use registry for sharing cache across the cluster, consider client-side load balancing using consistent hashing. See Consistent hashing example for more info. Exploring LLB \u00b6 BuildKit builds are based on a binary intermediate format called LLB that is used for defining the dependency graph for processes running part of your build. tl;dr: LLB is to Dockerfile what LLVM IR is to C. Marshaled as Protobuf messages Concurrently executable Efficiently cacheable Vendor-neutral (i.e. non-Dockerfile languages can be easily implemented) See solver/pb/ops.proto for the format definition, and see our examples for LLB applications.

Security reports are greatly appreciated and we will publicly thank you for it. We also like to send gifts\u2014if you're into schwag, make sure to let us know. We currently do not offer a paid security bounty program, but are not ruling it out in the future. Reporting other issues \u00b6 A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you encounter an issue. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report, and will thank you for it! Check that our issue database doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue. If you find a match, you can use the \"subscribe\" button to get notified on updates. Do not leave random \"+1\" or \"I have this too\" comments, as they only clutter the discussion, and don't help resolving it.

Include the steps required to reproduce the problem if possible and applicable. This information will help us review and fix your issue faster. When sending lengthy log-files, consider posting them as an attachment, instead of posting inline. Do not forget to remove sensitive data from your logfiles before submitting (you can replace those parts with \"REDACTED\"). Quick contribution tips and guidelines \u00b6 This section gives the experienced contributor some tips and guidelines. Build BuildKit from source \u00b6 Dependencies: runc containerd (if you want to use containerd worker) The following command installs buildkitd and buildctl to /usr/local/bin : make && sudo make install You can also use make binaries-all to prepare buildkitd.containerd_only and buildkitd.oci_only . To build containerized moby/buildkit:local and moby/buildkit:local-rootless images: make images Run the unit- and integration-tests \u00b6 Running tests: ./hack/test integration gateway dockerfile This runs all unit and integration tests, gateway client and dockerfile tests in a containerized environment. Locally, every package can be tested separately with standard Go tools, but integration tests are skipped if local user doesn't have enough permissions or worker binaries are not installed. The dockerfile tests run by first building new Dockerfile frontend image and then loading it to the test environment. Builtin Dockerfile frontend can be tested with regular integration tests. # test a specific package only TESTPKGS = ./client ./hack/test integration # run a specific test with all worker combinations TESTPKGS = ./client TESTFLAGS = \"--run /TestCallDiskUsage -v\" ./hack/test integration # run all integration tests with a specific worker # supported workers: oci, oci-rootless, containerd, containerd-1.1 TESTPKGS = ./client TESTFLAGS = \"--run //worker=containerd -v\" ./hack/test integration # run a specific dockerfile test only on labs channel DOCKERFILE_RELEASES = labs TESTFLAGS = \"--run /TestRunGlobalNetwork/worker=oci $ / -v\" ./hack/test dockerfile Set TEST_KEEP_CACHE=1 for the test framework to keep external dependant images in a docker volume if you are repeatedly calling ./hack/test script. This helps to avoid rate limiting on the remote registry side.

Found a bug and know how to fix it? Do it! We will appreciate it. If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve. We're trying very hard to keep BuildKit lean and focused. We don't want it to do everything for everybody. This means that we might decide against incorporating a new feature. However, there might be a way to implement that feature on top of BuildKit. Design and cleanup proposals \u00b6 You can propose new designs for existing features. You can also design entirely new features. We really appreciate contributors who want to refactor or otherwise cleanup our project.

You'll find us in #buildkit channel, and the #moby-project channel for general discussions. Twitter You can follow Moby Project Twitter feed to get updates on our products. You can also tweet us questions or just share blogs or stories. Sign your work \u00b6 The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below (from developercertificate.org ): Developer Certificate of Origin Version 1.1 Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors. 1 Letterman Drive Suite D4700 San Francisco, CA, 94129 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 By making a contribution to this project, I certify that: (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it. (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved. Then you just add a line to every git commit message: Signed - off - by : Joe Smith < joe . smith @email . com > Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.) If you set your user.name and user.email git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with git commit -s . Conventions \u00b6 Fork the repository and make changes on your fork in a feature branch Submit tests for your changes. See run the unit- and integration-tests for details. Update the documentation when creating or modifying features. Test your documentation changes for clarity, concision, and correctness, as well as a clean documentation build. Write clean code. Universally formatted code promotes ease of writing, reading, and maintenance. Always run gofmt -s -w file.go on each changed file before committing your changes. Most editors have plug-ins that do this automatically. Pull request descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a reference to all the issues that they address. Be sure that the commit messages also contain the relevant information. Successful Changes \u00b6 Before contributing large or high impact changes, make the effort to coordinate with the maintainers of the project before submitting a pull request. This prevents you from doing extra work that may or may not be merged. Large PRs that are just submitted without any prior communication are unlikely to be successful. While pull requests are the methodology for submitting changes to code, changes are much more likely to be accepted if they are accompanied by additional engineering work. While we don't define this explicitly, most of these goals are accomplished through communication of the design goals and subsequent solutions. Often times, it helps to first state the problem before presenting solutions. Typically, the best methods of accomplishing this are to submit an issue, stating the problem. This issue can include a problem statement and a checklist with requirements. If solutions are proposed, alternatives should be listed and eliminated. Even if the criteria for elimination of a solution is frivolous, say so. Larger changes typically work best with design documents. These are focused on providing context to the design at the time the feature was conceived and can inform future documentation contributions. Commit Messages \u00b6 Commit messages must start with a capitalized and short summary (max. 50 chars) written in the imperative, followed by an optional, more detailed explanatory text which is separated from the summary by an empty line. Commit messages should follow best practices, including explaining the context of the problem and how it was solved, including in caveats or follow up changes required. They should tell the story of the change and provide readers understanding of what led to it. If you're lost about what this even means, please see How to Write a Git Commit Message for a start. In practice, the best approach to maintaining a nice commit message is to leverage a git add -p and git commit --amend to formulate a solid changeset. This allows one to piece together a change, as information becomes available. If you squash a series of commits, don't just submit that. Re-write the commit message, as if the series of commits was a single stroke of brilliance. That said, there is no requirement to have a single commit for a PR, as long as each commit tells the story. For example, if there is a feature that requires a package, it might make sense to have the package in a separate commit then have a subsequent commit that uses it. Remember, you're telling part of the story with the commit message. Don't make your chapter weird. Review \u00b6 Code review comments may be added to your pull request. Discuss, then make the suggested modifications and push additional commits to your feature branch. Post a comment after pushing. New commits show up in the pull request automatically, but the reviewers are notified only when you comment. Pull requests must be cleanly rebased on top of master without multiple branches mixed into the PR. Git tip : If your PR no longer merges cleanly, use rebase master in your feature branch to update your pull request rather than merge master . Before you make a pull request, squash your commits into logical units of work using git rebase -i and git push -f . A logical unit of work is a consistent set of patches that should be reviewed together: for example, upgrading the version of a vendored dependency and taking advantage of its now available new feature constitute two separate units of work. Implementing a new function and calling it in another file constitute a single logical unit of work. The very high majority of submissions should have a single commit, so if in doubt: squash down to one. After every commit, make sure the test suite passes . Include documentation changes in the same pull request so that a revert would remove all traces of the feature or fix. Include an issue reference like closes #XXXX or fixes #XXXX in the PR description that close an issue. Including references automatically closes the issue on a merge. Do not add yourself to the AUTHORS file, as it is regenerated regularly from the Git history. See the Coding Style for further guidelines. Merge approval \u00b6 Project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code review to indicate acceptance, or use the Github review approval feature. Coding Style \u00b6 Unless explicitly stated, we follow all coding guidelines from the Go community. While some of these standards may seem arbitrary, they somehow seem to result in a solid, consistent codebase. It is possible that the code base does not currently comply with these guidelines. We are not looking for a massive PR that fixes this, since that goes against the spirit of the guidelines. All new contributions should make a best effort to clean up and make the code base better than they left it. Obviously, apply your best judgement. Remember, the goal here is to make the code base easier for humans to navigate and understand. Always keep that in mind when nudging others to comply. The rules: All code should be formatted with gofmt -s . All code should pass the default levels of golint . All code should follow the guidelines covered in Effective Go and Go Code Review Comments . Comment the code. Tell us the why, the history and the context. Document all declarations and methods, even private ones. Declare expectations, caveats and anything else that may be important. If a type gets exported, having the comments already there will ensure it's ready. Variable name length should be proportional to its context and no longer. noCommaALongVariableNameLikeThisIsNotMoreClearWhenASimpleCommentWouldDo . In practice, short methods will have short variable names and globals will have longer names. No underscores in package names. If you need a compound name, step back, and re-examine why you need a compound name. If you still think you need a compound name, lose the underscore. No utils or helpers packages. If a function is not general enough to warrant its own package, it has not been written generally enough to be a part of a util package. Just leave it unexported and well-documented. All tests should run with go test and outside tooling should not be required. No, we don't need another unit testing framework. Assertion packages are acceptable if they provide real incremental value. Even though we call these \"rules\" above, they are actually just guidelines. Since you've read all the rules, you now know that. If you are having trouble getting into the mood of idiomatic Go, we recommend reading through Effective Go . The Go Blog is also a great resource.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"community/contributing/#contribute-to-the-buildkit-project","text":"This page contains information about reporting issues as well as some tips and guidelines useful to experienced open source contributors.

Solver package is heavily optimized for deduplication of work, concurrent requests, remote and local caching and different per-vertex caching modes. It also allows operations and frontends to call back to itself with new definition that they have generated. The implementation of the solver is quite complicated, mostly because it is supposed to be performant with snapshot-based storage layer and distribution model using layer tarballs. It is expected that calculating the content based checksum of snapshots between every operation or after every command execution is too slow for common use cases and needs to be postponed to when it is likely to have a meaningful impact. Ideally, the user shouldn't realize that these optimizations are taking place and just get intuitive caching. It is also hoped that if some implementations can provide better cache capabilities, the solver would take advantage of that without requiring significant modification. In addition to avoiding content checksum scanning the implementation is also designed to make decisions with minimum available data. For example, for remote caching sources to be effective the solver will not require the cache to be loaded or exists for all the vertexes in the graph but will only load it for the final node that is determined to match cache. As another example, if one of the inputs (for example image) can produce a definition based cache match for a vertex, and another (for example local source files) can only produce a content-based(slower) cache match, the solver is designed to detect it and skip content-based check for the first input(that would cause a pull to happen). Build definition \u00b6 The solver takes in a build definition in the form of a content addressable operation definition that forms a graph. A vertex in this graph is defined by these properties: type Vertex interface { Digest () digest . Digest Options () VertexOptions Sys () interface {} Inputs () [] Edge Name () string } type Edge struct { Index Index Vertex Vertex } type Index int Every vertex has a content-addressable digest that represents a checksum of the definition graph up to that vertex including all of its inputs. If two vertexes have the same checksum, they are considered identical when they are executing concurrently. That means that if two other vertexes request a vertex with the same digest as an input, they will wait for the same operation to finish. The vertex digest can only be used for comparison while the solver is running and not between different invocations. For example, if parallel builds require using docker.io/library/alpine:latest image as one of the operations, it is pulled only once. But if a build using docker.io/library/alpine:latest was built earlier, the checksum based on that name can't be used for finding if the vertex was already built because the image might have changed in the registry and \"latest\" tag might be pointing to another image. Sys() method returns an object that is used to resolve the executor for the operation. This is how a definition can pass logic to the worker that will execute the task associated with the vertex, without the solver needing to know anything about the implementation. When the solver needs to execute a vertex, it will send this object to a worker, so the worker needs to be configured to understand the object returned by Sys() . The solver itself doesn't care how the operations are implemented and therefore doesn't define a type for this value. In LLB solver this value would be with type llb.Op . Inputs() returns an array of other vertexes the current vertex depends on. A vertex may have zero inputs. After an operation has executed, it returns an array of return references. If another operation wants to depend on any of these references they would define an input with that vertex and an index of the reference from the return array(starting from zero). Inputs need to be contained in the Digest() of the vertex - two vertexes with different inputs should never have the same digest. Options contain extra information that can be associated with the vertex but what doesn't change the definition(or equality check) of it. Normally this is either a hint to the solver, for example, to ignore cache when executing. It can also be used for associating messages with the vertex that can be helpful for tracing purposes. Operation interface \u00b6 Operation interface is how the solver can evaluate the properties of the actual vertex operation. These methods run on the worker, and their implementation is determined by the value of vertex.Sys() . The solver is configured with a \"resolve\" function that can convert a vertex.Sys() into an Op . // Op is an implementation for running a vertex type Op interface { // CacheMap returns structure describing how the operation is cached. // Currently only roots are allowed to return multiple cache maps per op. CacheMap ( context . Context , int ) ( * CacheMap , bool , error ) // Exec runs an operation given results from previous operations. // Note that this is not the process execution but can have any definition. Exec ( ctx context . Context , inputs [] Result ) ( outputs [] Result , err error ) } type CacheMap struct { // Digest is a base digest for operation that needs to be combined with // inputs cache or selectors for dependencies. Digest digest . Digest Deps [] struct { // Optional digest that is merged with the cache key of the input Selector digest . Digest // Optional function that returns a digest for the input based on its // return value ComputeDigestFunc ResultBasedCacheFunc } } type ResultBasedCacheFunc func ( context . Context , Result ) ( digest . Digest , error ) // Result is an abstract return value for a solve type Result interface { ID () string Release ( context . Context ) error Sys () interface {} } There are two functions that every operation defines. One describes how to calculate a cache key for a vertex and another how to execute it. CacheMap is a description for calculating the cache key. It contains a digest that is combined with the cache keys of the inputs to determine the stable checksum that can be used to cache the operation result. For the vertexes that don't have inputs(roots), it is important that this digest is a stable secure checksum. For example, in LLB this digest is a manifest digest for container images or a commit SHA for git sources. CacheMap may also define optional selectors or content-based cache functions for its inputs. A selector is combined with the input cache key and useful for describing when different parts of an input are being used, and inputs cache key needs to be customized. Content-based cache function allows computing a new cache key for an input after it has completed. In LLB this is used for calculating cache key based on the checksum of file contents of the input snapshots. Exec executes the operation defined by a vertex by passing in the results of the inputs. Shared graph \u00b6 After new build request is sent to the solver, it first loads all the vertexes to the shared graph structure. For status tracking, a job instance needs to be created, and vertexes are loaded through jobs. A job ID is assigned to every vertex. If vertex with the same digest has already been loaded to the shared graph, a new job ID is appended to the existing record. When the job finishes, it removes all of its references from the loaded vertex. The resources are released if no more references remain. Loading a vertex also creates a progress writer associated with it and sets up the cache sources associated with the specific vertex. After vertexes have been loaded to the job, it is safe to request a result from an edge pointing to a previously loaded vertex. To do this build(ctx, Edge) (CachedResult, error) method is called on the static scheduler instance associated with the solver. Scheduler \u00b6 The scheduler is a component responsible for invoking the individual operations needed to find the result for the graph. While the build definition is defined with vertexes, the scheduler is solving edges. In the case of LLB solver, a result of a solved edge is associated with a snapshot. Usually, to solve an edge, the input edges need to be solved first and this can be done concurrently, but there are many exceptions like edge may be cached but its input might be not, or solving one input might cause a cache hit while solving others would just be wasteful. Scheduler tries do handle all these cases. The scheduler is implemented as a single threaded non-blocking event loop. The single threaded constraint is for simplicity and might be removed in the future - currently, it is not known if this would have any performance impact. All the events in the scheduler have one fixed sender and receiver. The interface for interacting with the scheduler is to create a \"pipe\" between a sender and a receiver. One or both sides of the pipe may be an edge instance of the graph. If a pipe is added it to the scheduler and an edge receives an event from the pipe, the scheduler will \"unpark\" that edge so it can process all the events it had received. The unpark handler for an edge needs to be non-blocking and execute quickly. The edge will process the data from the incoming events and update its internal state. When calling unpark, the scheduler has already separated out the sender and receiver sides of the pipes that in the code are referred as incoming and outgoing requests. The incoming requests are usually requests to retrieve a result or a cache key from an edge. If it appears that an edge doesn't have enough internal state to satisfy the requests, it can make new pipes and register them with the scheduler. These new pipes are generally of two types: ones asking for some async function to be completed and others that request an input edge to reach a specific state first. To avoid bugs and deadlocks in this logic, the unpark method needs to follow the following rules. If unpark has finished without completing all incoming requests it needs to create outgoing requests. Similarly, if an incoming request remains pending, at least one outgoing request needs to exist as well. Failing to comply with this rule will cause the scheduler to panic as a precaution to avoid leaks and hiding errors. Edge state \u00b6 During unpark, edge state is incremented until it can fulfill the incoming requests. An edge can be in the following states: initial, cache-fast, cache-slow, completed. Completed edge contains a reference to the final result, in-progress edge may have zero or more cache keys. The initial state is the starting state for any edge. If a state has reached a cache-fast state, it means that all the definition based cache key lookups have been performed. Cache-slow means that content-based cache lookup has been performed as well. If possible, the scheduler will avoid looking up the slow keys of inputs if they are unnecessary for solving current edge. The unpark method is split into four phases. The first phase processes all incoming events (responses from outgoing requests or new incoming requests) that caused the unpark to be called. These contain responses from async functions like calls to get the cachemap, execution result or content-based checksum for an input, or responses from input edges when their state or number of cache keys has changed. All the results are stored in edge's internal state. For the new cache keys, a query is performed to determine if any of them can create potential matches to the current edge. After that, if any of the updates caused changes to edge's properties, a new state is calculated for the current vertex. In this step, all potential cache keys from inputs can cause new cache keys for the edge to be created and the status of an edge might be updated. Third, the edge will go over all of its incoming requests, to determine if the current internal state is sufficient for satisfying them all. There are a couple of possibilities how this check may end up. If all requests can be completed and there are no outgoing requests the requests finish and unpark method returns. If there are outgoing requests but the edge has reached the completed state or all incoming requests have been canceled, the outgoing requests are canceled. This is an async operation as well and will cause unpark to be called again after completion. If this condition didn't apply but requests could be completed and there are outgoing requests, then the incoming request is answered but not completed. The receiver can then decide to cancel this request if needed. If no new data has appeared to answer the incoming requests, the desired state for an edge is determined for an edge from the incoming requests, and we continue to the next step. The fourth step sets up outgoing requests based on the desired state determined in the third step. If the current state requires calling any async functions to move forward then it is done here. We will also loop through all the inputs to determine if it is important to raise their desired state. Depending on what inputs can produce content based cache keys and what inputs have already returned possible cache matches, the desired state for inputs may be raised at different times. When an edge needs to resolve an operation to call the async CacheMap and Exec methods, it does so by calling back to the shared graph. This makes sure that two different edges pointing to the same vertex do not execute twice. The result values for the operation that is shared by the edges is also cached until the vertex is cleaned up. Progress reporting is also handled and forwarded to the job through this shared vertex instance. Edge state is cleaned up when a final job that loaded the vertexes that they are connected to is discarded. Cache providers \u00b6 Cache providers determine if there is a result that matches the cache keys generated during the build that could be reused instead of fully reevaluating the vertex and its inputs. There can be multiple cache providers, and specific providers can be defined per vertex using the vertex options. There are multiple backend implementations for cache providers, in-memory one used in unit tests, the default local one using bbolt and one based on cache manifests in a remote registry. Simplified cache provider has following methods: Query ( ... ) ([] * CacheKey , error ) Records ( ck * CacheKey ) ([] * CacheRecord , error ) Load ( ctx context . Context , rec * CacheRecord ) ( Result , error ) Save ( key * CacheKey , s Result ) ( * ExportableCacheKey , error ) Query method is used to determine if there exist a possible cache link between the input and a vertex. It takes parameters provided by op.CacheMap and cache keys returned by the calling the same method on its inputs. If a cache key has been found, the matching records can be asked for them. A cache key can have zero or more records. Having a record means that a cached result can be loaded for a specific vertex. The solver supports partial cache chains, meaning that not all inputs need to have a cache record to match cache for a vertex. Load method is used to load a specific record into a result reference. This value is the same type as the one returned by the op.Exec method. Save allows adding more records to the cache. Merging edges \u00b6 One final piece of solver logic allows merging two edges into one when they have both returned the same cache key. In practice, this appears for example when a build uses image references alpine:latest and alpine@sha256:abcabc in its definition and they actually point to the same image. Another case where this appears is when same source files from different sources are being used as part of the build. After scheduler has called unpark() on an edge it checks it the method added any new cache keys to its state. If it did it will check its internal index if another active edge already exists with the same cache key. If it does it performs some basic validation, for example checking that the new edge has not explicitly asked cache to be ignored, and if it passes, merges the states of two edges. In the result of the merge, the edge that was checked is deleted, its ongoing requests are canceled and the incoming ones are added to the original edge.","title":"Solver design"},{"location":"design/solver/#buildkit-solver-design","text":"The solver is a component in BuildKit responsible for parsing the build definition and scheduling the operations to the workers for execution.

Usually, to solve an edge, the input edges need to be solved first and this can be done concurrently, but there are many exceptions like edge may be cached but its input might be not, or solving one input might cause a cache hit while solving others would just be wasteful. Scheduler tries do handle all these cases. The scheduler is implemented as a single threaded non-blocking event loop. The single threaded constraint is for simplicity and might be removed in the future - currently, it is not known if this would have any performance impact. All the events in the scheduler have one fixed sender and receiver. The interface for interacting with the scheduler is to create a \"pipe\" between a sender and a receiver. One or both sides of the pipe may be an edge instance of the graph. If a pipe is added it to the scheduler and an edge receives an event from the pipe, the scheduler will \"unpark\" that edge so it can process all the events it had received. The unpark handler for an edge needs to be non-blocking and execute quickly. The edge will process the data from the incoming events and update its internal state. When calling unpark, the scheduler has already separated out the sender and receiver sides of the pipes that in the code are referred as incoming and outgoing requests. The incoming requests are usually requests to retrieve a result or a cache key from an edge. If it appears that an edge doesn't have enough internal state to satisfy the requests, it can make new pipes and register them with the scheduler. These new pipes are generally of two types: ones asking for some async function to be completed and others that request an input edge to reach a specific state first. To avoid bugs and deadlocks in this logic, the unpark method needs to follow the following rules. If unpark has finished without completing all incoming requests it needs to create outgoing requests. Similarly, if an incoming request remains pending, at least one outgoing request needs to exist as well. Failing to comply with this rule will cause the scheduler to panic as a precaution to avoid leaks and hiding errors.","title":"Scheduler"},{"location":"design/solver/#edge-state","text":"During unpark, edge state is incremented until it can fulfill the incoming requests. An edge can be in the following states: initial, cache-fast, cache-slow, completed. Completed edge contains a reference to the final result, in-progress edge may have zero or more cache keys. The initial state is the starting state for any edge. If a state has reached a cache-fast state, it means that all the definition based cache key lookups have been performed. Cache-slow means that content-based cache lookup has been performed as well. If possible, the scheduler will avoid looking up the slow keys of inputs if they are unnecessary for solving current edge. The unpark method is split into four phases. The first phase processes all incoming events (responses from outgoing requests or new incoming requests) that caused the unpark to be called. These contain responses from async functions like calls to get the cachemap, execution result or content-based checksum for an input, or responses from input edges when their state or number of cache keys has changed. All the results are stored in edge's internal state. For the new cache keys, a query is performed to determine if any of them can create potential matches to the current edge. After that, if any of the updates caused changes to edge's properties, a new state is calculated for the current vertex. In this step, all potential cache keys from inputs can cause new cache keys for the edge to be created and the status of an edge might be updated. Third, the edge will go over all of its incoming requests, to determine if the current internal state is sufficient for satisfying them all. There are a couple of possibilities how this check may end up. If all requests can be completed and there are no outgoing requests the requests finish and unpark method returns. If there are outgoing requests but the edge has reached the completed state or all incoming requests have been canceled, the outgoing requests are canceled. This is an async operation as well and will cause unpark to be called again after completion. If this condition didn't apply but requests could be completed and there are outgoing requests, then the incoming request is answered but not completed. The receiver can then decide to cancel this request if needed. If no new data has appeared to answer the incoming requests, the desired state for an edge is determined for an edge from the incoming requests, and we continue to the next step. The fourth step sets up outgoing requests based on the desired state determined in the third step. If the current state requires calling any async functions to move forward then it is done here. We will also loop through all the inputs to determine if it is important to raise their desired state. Depending on what inputs can produce content based cache keys and what inputs have already returned possible cache matches, the desired state for inputs may be raised at different times. When an edge needs to resolve an operation to call the async CacheMap and Exec methods, it does so by calling back to the shared graph. This makes sure that two different edges pointing to the same vertex do not execute twice. The result values for the operation that is shared by the edges is also cached until the vertex is cleaned up. Progress reporting is also handled and forwarded to the job through this shared vertex instance. Edge state is cleaned up when a final job that loaded the vertexes that they are connected to is discarded.","title":"Edge state"},{"location":"design/solver/#cache-providers","text":"Cache providers determine if there is a result that matches the cache keys generated during the build that could be reused instead of fully reevaluating the vertex and its inputs. There can be multiple cache providers, and specific providers can be defined per vertex using the vertex options. There are multiple backend implementations for cache providers, in-memory one used in unit tests, the default local one using bbolt and one based on cache manifests in a remote registry. Simplified cache provider has following methods: Query ( ... ) ([] * CacheKey , error ) Records ( ck * CacheKey ) ([] * CacheRecord , error ) Load ( ctx context . Context , rec * CacheRecord ) ( Result , error ) Save ( key * CacheKey , s Result ) ( * ExportableCacheKey , error ) Query method is used to determine if there exist a possible cache link between the input and a vertex. It takes parameters provided by op.CacheMap and cache keys returned by the calling the same method on its inputs. If a cache key has been found, the matching records can be asked for them. A cache key can have zero or more records. Having a record means that a cached result can be loaded for a specific vertex. The solver supports partial cache chains, meaning that not all inputs need to have a cache record to match cache for a vertex. Load method is used to load a specific record into a result reference. This value is the same type as the one returned by the op.Exec method. Save allows adding more records to the cache.","title":"Cache providers"},{"location":"design/solver/#merging-edges","text":"One final piece of solver logic allows merging two edges into one when they have both returned the same cache key. In practice, this appears for example when a build uses image references alpine:latest and alpine@sha256:abcabc in its definition and they actually point to the same image. Another case where this appears is when same source files from different sources are being used as part of the build. After scheduler has called unpark() on an edge it checks it the method added any new cache keys to its state. If it did it will check its internal index if another active edge already exists with the same cache key. If it does it performs some basic validation, for example checking that the new edge has not explicitly asked cache to be ignored, and if it passes, merges the states of two edges. In the result of the merge, the edge that was checked is deleted, its ongoing requests are canceled and the incoming ones are added to the original edge.","title":"Merging edges"},{"location":"examples/build-using-dockerfile/","text":"Note Source code for this example available in ./examples/build-using-dockerfile build-using-dockerfile example \u00b6 BuildKit has been integrated to docker build since Docker 18.06.

Images for Dockerfile frontends are available at docker/dockerfile repository. To use the external frontend, the first line of your Dockerfile needs to be # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.3 pointing to the specific image you want to use. BuildKit also ships with Dockerfile frontend builtin, but it is recommended to use an external image to make sure that all users use the same version on the builder and to pick up bugfixes automatically without waiting for a new version of BuildKit or Docker engine. The images are published on two channels: latest and labs . The latest channel uses semver versioning while labs uses an incrementing number . This means the labs channel may remove a feature without incrementing the major component of a version, and you may want to pin the image to a specific revision. Even when syntaxes change in between releases on labs channel, the old versions are guaranteed to be backward compatible.

RUN --network=none \u00b6 The command is run with no network access ( lo is still available, but is isolated to this process) Example: isolating external effects \u00b6 # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.3 FROM python:3.6 ADD mypackage.tgz wheels/ RUN --network = none pip install --find-links wheels mypackage pip will only be able to install the packages provided in the tarfile, which can be controlled by an earlier build stage. RUN --network=host \u00b6 The command is run in the host's network environment (similar to docker build --network=host , but on a per-instruction basis) Caution The use of --network=host is protected by the network.host entitlement, which needs to be enabled when starting the buildkitd daemon ( --allow-insecure-entitlement network.host ) and on the build request ( --allow network.host ). RUN --network=default \u00b6 Equivalent to not supplying a flag at all, the command is run in the default network for the build. Security context RUN --security=... \u00b6 To use this flag, set Dockerfile version to labs channel. # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.3-labs RUN --security=insecure \u00b6 With --security=insecure , builder runs the command without sandbox in insecure mode, which allows to run flows requiring elevated privileges (e.g. containerd). This is equivalent to running docker run --privileged . Caution In order to access this feature, entitlement security.insecure should be enabled when starting the buildkitd daemon ( --allow-insecure-entitlement security.insecure ) and for a build request ( --allow security.insecure ). Example: check entitlements \u00b6 # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.3-labs FROM ubuntu RUN --security = insecure cat /proc/self/status | grep CapEff #84 0.093 CapEff: 0000003fffffffff RUN --security=sandbox \u00b6 Default sandbox mode can be activated via --security=sandbox , but that is no-op. Here-Documents \u00b6 This feature is available since docker/dockerfile:1.4.0 release. # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.4 Here-documents allow redirection of subsequent Dockerfile lines to the input of RUN or COPY commands. If such command contains a here-document Dockerfile will consider the next lines until the line only containing a here-doc delimiter as part of the same command. Example: running a multi-line script \u00b6 # syntax = docker/dockerfile:1.4 FROM debian RUN <<eot bash apt-get update apt-get install -y vim eot If the command only contains a here-document, its contents is evaluated with the default shell. # syntax = docker/dockerfile:1.4 FROM debian RUN <<eot mkdir -p foo/bar eot Alternatively, shebang header can be used to define an interpreter. # syntax = docker/dockerfile:1.4 FROM python:3.6 RUN <<eot #!/usr/bin/env python print ( \"hello world\" ) eot More complex examples may use multiple here-documents. # syntax = docker/dockerfile:1.4 FROM alpine RUN <<FILE1 cat > file1 && <<FILE 2 cat > file2 I am first FILE1 I am second FILE2 Example: creating inline files \u00b6 In COPY commands source parameters can be replaced with here-doc indicators.

BuildKit also ships with Dockerfile frontend builtin, but it is recommended to use an external image to make sure that all users use the same version on the builder and to pick up bugfixes automatically without waiting for a new version of BuildKit or Docker engine. The images are published on two channels: latest and labs . The latest channel uses semver versioning while labs uses an incrementing number . This means the labs channel may remove a feature without incrementing the major component of a version, and you may want to pin the image to a specific revision.

This document describes the configuration that allows buildkit to lazily pull stargz / eStargz -formatted images from registries and how to obtain stargz/eStargz images. By default, buildkit doesn't pull images until they are strictly needed. For example, during a build, buildkit doesn't pull the base image until it runs commands on it (e.g. RUN Dockerfile instruction) or until it exports stages as tarballs, etc. Additionally, if the image is formatted as stargz/eStargz, buildkit with the configuration described here can skip pull of that image even when it's needed (e.g. on RUN and COPY instructions). Instead, it mounts that image from the registry to the node and lazily fetches necessary files (or chunks for big files) contained in that image on demand. This can hopefully reduce the time to take for the build. This document describes the configuration and usage of this feature. For more details about stargz/eStargz image format, please see also Stargz and eStargz image formats section. Known limitations \u00b6 If you are using containerd worker, stargz snapshotter ( containerd-stargz-grpc ) needs to be run and configured separately. Rootless execution is currently unsupported. Enabling lazy pulling of stargz/eStargz images \u00b6 Buildkit supports two ways to enable lazy pulling of stargz/eStargz images. Using builtin support (recommended) \u00b6 OCI worker has builtin support for stargz/eStargz. You can enable this feature by running buildkitd with an option --oci-worker-snapshotter=stargz . buildkitd --oci-worker-snapshotter = stargz This is the easiest way to use this lazy pull feature on buildkit. Currently, this configuration is unsupported for containerd worker. Example of building an image with lazy pull \u00b6 Once buildkitd starts with the above configuration, stargz/eStargz images can be lazily pulled. For example, we build the following golang binary with buildkit. package main import \"fmt\" func main () { fmt . Println ( \"Hello, world!\" ) } The example Dockerfile which leverages eStargz-formatted base image will be the following. # Uses eStargz-formatted golang image as the base image. This isn't pulled here. FROM ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-esgz AS dev # Copies the source code from the context. The base image is mounted and lazily pulled. COPY ./hello.go /hello.go # Runs go compiler on that base image. The base image is mounted and lazily pulled. RUN go build -o /hello /hello.go FROM scratch # Harvesting the result binary. COPY --from = dev /hello / Then this can be built with skipping pull of ghcr.io/stargz-containers/golang:1.15.3-buster-esgz . Instead, this image will be mounted from the registry to the node and necessary chunks of contents (e.g. go command binary, library, etc.) are partially fetched from that registry on demand. $ buildctl build --frontend dockerfile.v0 \\ --local context=/tmp/hello \\ --local dockerfile=/tmp/hello \\ --output type=local,dest=./ $ ./hello Hello, world! Note that when a stage is exported (e.g. to the registry), the base image (even stargz/eStargz) of that stage needs to be pulled to copy it to the destination. However if the destination is a registry and the target repository already contains some blobs of that image or cross repository blob mount can be used, buildkit keeps these blobs lazy. Using proxy (standalone) snapshotter \u00b6 This is another way to enable stargz-based lazy pull. Stargz Snapshotter ( containerd-stargz-grpc ) needs to be installed. Note that buildkit's registry configuration doesn't propagate to stargz snapshotter so it needs to be configured separately when you use private/mirror repositories. This configuration is for users of containerd worker and ones trying other versions of stargz snapshotter than built into OCI worker. With OCI worker \u00b6 Spawn containerd-stargz-grpc as a separated process. Then run buildkitd with an option --oci-worker-proxy-snapshotter-path=/run/containerd-stargz-grpc/containerd-stargz-grpc.sock which makes it recognize this snapshotter via the socket. containerd-stargz-grpc buildkitd --oci-worker-snapshotter = stargz \\ --oci-worker-proxy-snapshotter-path = /run/containerd-stargz-grpc/containerd-stargz-grpc.sock With containerd worker \u00b6 Configure containerd's config.toml (default = /etc/containerd/config.toml ) to make it recognize stargz snapshotter as a proxy snapshotter . [proxy_plugins] [proxy_plugins.stargz] type = \"snapshot\" address = \"/run/containerd-stargz-grpc/containerd-stargz-grpc.sock\" Then spawn containerd-stargz-grpc and containerd , and run buildkitd with an option --containerd-worker-snapshotter=stargz which tells containerd to use stargz snapshotter. containerd-stargz-grpc containerd buildkitd --containerd-worker-snapshotter = stargz --oci-worker = false --containerd-worker = true Registry-related configurations for standalone stargz snapshotter \u00b6 When you use standalone stargz snapshotter, registry configuration needs to be done for the stargz snapshotter process, separately. Create a configuration toml file which contains the registry configuration for stargz snapshotter (e.g. /etc/containerd-stargz-grpc/config.toml ). The configuration format differs from buildkit . For more information about this format, please see also docs in the repository . [[resolver.host.\"exampleregistry.io\".mirrors]] host = \"examplemirror.io\" Then pass this file to stargz snapshotter through --config option. containerd-stargz-grpc --config = /etc/containerd-stargz-grpc/config.toml Stargz and eStargz image formats \u00b6 Stargz and eStargz are OCI/Docker-compatible image formats that can be lazily pulled from standard registries (e.g. Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc). Because they are backwards-compatible to OCI/Docker images, they can run on standard runtimes (e.g. Docker, containerd, etc.). Stargz is proposed by Google CRFS project . eStargz is an extended format of stargz by Stargz Snapshotter . It comes with additional features including chunk verification and prefetch for avoiding the overhead of on-demand fetching. For more details about lazy pull with stargz/eStargz images, please refer to the docs on these repositories. Creating stargz/eStargz images \u00b6 Building eStargz image with BuildKit \u00b6 BuildKit supports creating eStargz as one of the compression types. As shown in the following, compression=estargz creates an eStargz-formatted image. Specifying oci-mediatypes=true option is highly recommended for enabling layer verification of eStargz. buildctl build ... \\ --output type = image,name = docker.io/username/image,push = true,compression = estargz,oci-mediatypes = true Building eStargz is only supported by OCI worker. compression option isn't applied to layers that already exist in the cache (including the base images). Thus if you create eStargz image using non-eStargz base images, you need to specify force-compression=true option as well for applying the compression config to all existing layers. BuildKit doesn't support prefetch-based optimization of eStargz . To enable full feature of eStargz, you can also use other tools as described in the next section. Other methods to obtain stargz/eStargz images \u00b6 Pre-converted stargz/eStargz images are available at ghcr.io/stargz-containers repository (mainly for testing purpose). You can also create any stargz/eStargz image using the variety of tools including the following. nerdctl : Docker-compatible CLI for containerd and BuildKit. This supports convert subcommand to convert an OCI/Docker image into eStargz. ctr-remote : containerd CLI developed in stargz snapshotter project. This supports converting an OCI/Docker image into eStargz and optimizing it. stargzify : CLI tool to convert an OCI/Docker image to stargz. This is developed in CRFS project. Creating eStargz is unsupported. There also other tools including Kaniko, ko, builpacks.io that support eStargz creation.

To allow running rootless buildkitd without --oci-worker-no-process-sandbox , run docker run with --security-opt systempaths=unconfined . (For Kubernetes, set securityContext.procMount to Unmasked .) The --security-opt systempaths=unconfined flag disables the masks for the /proc mount in the container and potentially allows reading and writing dangerous kernel files, but it is safe when you are running buildkitd as non-root.","title":"About --oci-worker-no-process-sandbox"},{"location":"user-guides/rootless-mode/#change-uidgid","text":"The moby/buildkit:rootless image has the following
