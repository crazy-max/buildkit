```dockerfile
LABEL <key>=<value> <key>=<value> <key>=<value> ...
```

The `LABEL` instruction adds metadata to an image. A `LABEL` is a
key-value pair. To include spaces within a `LABEL` value, use quotes and
backslashes as you would in command-line parsing. A few usage examples:

```dockerfile
LABEL "com.example.vendor"="ACME Incorporated"
LABEL com.example.label-with-value="foo"
LABEL version="1.0"
LABEL description="This text illustrates \
that label-values can span multiple lines."
```

An image can have more than one label. You can specify multiple labels on a
single line. Prior to Docker 1.10, this decreased the size of the final image,
but this is no longer the case. You may still choose to specify multiple labels
in a single instruction, in one of the following two ways:

```dockerfile
LABEL multi.label1="value1" multi.label2="value2" other="value3"
```

```dockerfile
LABEL multi.label1="value1" \
      multi.label2="value2" \
      other="value3"
```

Labels included in base or parent images (images in the `FROM` line) are
inherited by your image. If a label already exists but with a different value,
the most-recently-applied value overrides any previously-set value.

To view an image's labels, use the `docker image inspect` command. You can use
the `--format` option to show just the labels;

```console
$ docker image inspect --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}' myimage
```

```json
{
  "com.example.vendor": "ACME Incorporated",
  "com.example.label-with-value": "foo",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "This text illustrates that label-values can span multiple lines.",
  "multi.label1": "value1",
  "multi.label2": "value2",
  "other": "value3"
}
```
